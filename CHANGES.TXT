CHANGES
-------

The major number changes for such things as code rewrites, changes in
syntax, and/or dramatic changes in functionality. The minor number
changes for corrections, enhancements, etc. made to the code. There
is no set schedule for releases.

--TODO--

   +	Consider adding LDAP file support.


--1.5--

   !	sample.mc.in: Removed from define(`_FFR_MILTER', `1')dnl

--1.4--

   *	Has been proven to work with Postix 2.3. Thanks to Jan Ahrens.

   -	Dropped adding of informational header X-Scanned-By when mail is
	BCCed to one or more recipients. Plus this header relies on
	{if_addr} macro, which Postfix 2.3 has no equivalent.

--1.3--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.63.

   !	Documentation corrections and updates for access-db.

   +	access-db now supports socket-map, flat-file, and SQLite3
	lookups in addition to Berkeley DB. The SQLite3 behaviour
	can be disabled via LibSnert's ./configure script.

   +	Added milter-bcc-connect: default tag, which handles all the
	usual lookups and allows for a default Bcc "for all
	connections". Requested by Andoni Auzmendi.

   +	Added milter-bcc-from:, milter-bcc-to:, and milter-bcc-all
   	default tags for consistency with milter-bcc-connect.

   +	Added support for SKIP action in place of the format list. The
	SKIP halts the access.db lookup resulting in no Bcc address
	being added. Requested by Andoni Auzmendi. This was already
	possible by simply specifying an empty format list. Adding
	SKIP just makes it clearer.

   !	milter-bcc-auth: is now applied _before_ testing for the null
	sender, since it's possible to send authenticated DSN or MDN
	messages.

--1.2--

  !!	License 1.4 which provides additional details with regards to
  	possible license controls used, the possibility of "phone
  	home code" and its general contents, and related privacy
  	statement.

   +	Add check for filterOpen() got NULL socket address pointer
	passed to filterOpen() which inidicates an unsupported address
	type. The connection is simply accepted to bypass the milter.

--1.1--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.61.

  !!	Complete replacement of option specification and no backwards.
	compatibility. The newer format allows for better integration
	of previously undocumented libsnert options and for the
	inclusion of future enhancements.

   !	filterClose(): remove reporting of "null workspace error",
	which can occur when a client connection is rejected before or
	by filterOpen().

   !	Minor corrections for gcc -Wall warnings.

--1.0--

   !	Reverted back to libmilter's default (7210s) timeout. This
	should silence many of the reported sendmail to milter timeout
	errors and/or broken connections caused by the milter timing
	out sooner than sendmail does with the current SMTP client.
	The sendmail defaults for each SMTP command and receiving the
	message content is 1h each and so libmilter allows for 2h 10s.
	But in theory you could be DoS for between 5 and 104 hours per
	connection. If you want to change this then set in
	sendmail.mc:

		define(`confTO_DATABLOCK',      `30m')
		define(`confTO_COMMAND',        `5m')

--0.12--

   !	Replaced use of LIBSNERT_WITH_BERKELEY_DB by HAVE_DB_H due to
   	changes in LibSnert/1.59.

--0.11--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.57

   +	Added support for

   		milter-bcc-auth:auth_authen		RHS
   		milter-bcc-auth:			RHS

--0.10--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.56

   !	Changed install.sh.in to create /var/run/mitler/ directory
   	owned by milter:milter and change the default PID_FILE and
   	SOCKET_FILE paths. This provides better privelage/security
   	separation since the milters run as milter:milter.

--0.9--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.53

   +	Add support for milter-bcc-connect: tag. Requested by Alexc.

   !	Fixed potential memory leak in filterMail() and filterRcpt()
	not free'ing the previously allocated access DB value string
	in the event of an error from addBccRecipient().

   +	The format-path can now be a comma separated list of format-
	path strings.

--0.8--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.45

   -	Remove use smdbReload(). This function was removed in libsnert-1.45.

--0.7--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.41

   !	Fixed configure.in script to better handle Berkeley DB library
   	and header searches. All these cases should now work.

   		./configure
   		./configure --with-db
   		./configure --with-db=/usr/local/BerkeleyDB-4.2
   		./configure --without-db

   -	configure.in: Removed gcc option -fvolatile, which is no longer
   	supported in as of gcc 3.4.

   +	The milter now starts as a background process and can kill a
	previous instance of itself using the -x option. The -X option
	is undocumented, but starts the application as a foreground
	process for the purpose of debugging.

   +	Added support for a /etc/mail/milter-name.cf file that can
   	contain command-line options and an optional socket argument.

   !	The socket argument is now optional.

   !	The above three changes allow for a simplified startup script
	template for use by all my milters.

   !	Fix possible memory leak on out-of-memory errors. Rare.

   +	The right-hand-side of a milter-bcc-* tagged value is now
   	specified as a general purpose formatted path. Requested by
   	Michael Zakharoff.

   !	MAIL FROM:<> is now skipped. It makes no sense to look it up
	and Bcc someone all the bounce messages.

   !	Fixed bug where X-Scanned-By header was not being added.

  !!	Updated LICENSE.TXT.

--0.6--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.39

   !	Status changed from alpha to beta.

   !	Fixed the configuration file to recognise OpenBSD. Reported by
	Francisco of Blackant dot Net.

   !	Fixed the start-up script to unalias shell function names
	before defining the function. Reported by Francisco of
	Blackant dot Net.

--0.5--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.38

   +	Bumped version to clearly indicate a new version after some
	people got hold of pre-release work in progress.

--0.4--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.37

   +	Add VERSION.TXT to configuration for use by sendmail.shtml.

   !	Fix makefile ownership target to assert correct state directory
   	permissions.

   !	atExitCleanUp() now calls smdbClose() which mutex protects the
   	call to db->close(). For the access database this is not so
   	important, but it clearer code.


--0.3--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.36

   +	Set working directory to the state directory, where is can write
   	a core file in the event of crash.

   !	nullWorkSpace() now takes a `where' string to report in what hook
   	it failed.

   !	Replaced some commom code shared by all my milters. See libsnert
   	Sendmail Filter API (smf).

   !	Standardised the -v option across all my milters. Also support
   	textual bit names.

   ! 	Modified license.

--0.2--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.35 for major smdb() update to solve threading
   	issues and a possible memory corruption problem

   +	Add an instanceCount for independent tagging of log message separate
   	from the queue id.

   +	Berkeley DB support is assumed and required at this time.

   !	vSetReply() not checks for an MI_FAILURE from smfi_setreply().

--0.1--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.34.
